We present a computational method to identify putative drug repurposing candidates through network clustering. A weighted drug-disease network was compiled using known drug-target and disease-gene associations. The disease-drug pairs were assembled in communities detected in the heterogeneous network. Presented at **ICIBM 2013**. [Read more](https://bmcsystbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1752-0509-7-S5-S6)
