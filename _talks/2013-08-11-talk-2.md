We present a computational method to identify putative drug repurposing candidates through network clustering. A weighted drug-disease network was compiled using known drug-target and disease-gene associations. The disease-drug pairs were assembled in communities detected in the heterogeneous network. Presented at **ICIBM 2013**.
