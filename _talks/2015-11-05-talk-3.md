Phenoxome is a computational application that improves the efficiency of the interpretation of WES/WGS data by providing a prioritized list of genes coupled with variant analyses from presenting patient phenotypes. We expect more intelligent computational models will be developed to increase accuracy in variant classification and further reduce the processing time.
