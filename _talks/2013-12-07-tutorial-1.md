In this paper we present a novel framework capable of finding statistically significant biclusters on ENCODE ChIP sequencing datasets. Our goal is to discover low biclusters with low variance in terms of gene expression, which in theory shold point to coherent functional modules. Presented at **ICDMW 2013**.
