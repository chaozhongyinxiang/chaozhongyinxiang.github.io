Drug repositioning is a viable strategy both to replenish the drying out drug pipelines and to surmount the innovation gap. Using known disease-gene and drug-target relationships, we built a weighted disease and drug heterogeneous network. The nodes represent drugs or diseases while the edges represent shared gene, biological process, pathway, phenotype or a combination of these features.
