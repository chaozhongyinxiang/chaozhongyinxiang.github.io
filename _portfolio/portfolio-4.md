Despite rapid advancements, the major challenge still resides in identifying the casual variants among the thousands of variants detected during clinical exome sequencing testing. To improve the clinical exome diagnostic efficiency, we developed [Phenoxome](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41431-018-0328-7), a robust phenotype-driven model that adopts a network-based approach to facilitate automated variant prioritization. Phenoxome dissects the phenotypic manifestation of a patient in concert with their genomic profile to filter and then prioritize variants that are likely to affect the function of the gene.
