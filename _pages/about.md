I am a bioinformatics scientist/computer scientist in the [Division of Genomic Diagnostics](https://www.chop.edu/centers-programs/division-genomic-diagnostics) at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. I develop machine learning and data mining methods to facilitate clinical pediatric diagnostics.

I received my Ph.D from the [Computer Science Department of University of Cincinnati](https://ceas.uc.edu/academics/departments/electrical-engineering-computer-science.html), together with the [Biomedical Informatics Department of Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center](https://www.cincinnatichildrens.org/research/divisions/b/bmi). I also have a MSc from Department of Electronic Enegineering at University of York. 

I am interested in developing applications of machine learning in biomedical informatics, with a particular focus on genetics and genomics. Previously, I have also worked on problems such as gene-network mining, drug repurposing and ncRNA analysis.

You can find some of my previous works and ongoing projects on this site. You may also reach me [here](mailto:wuco@mail.uc.edu) as collaborations are always welcome.
