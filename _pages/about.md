I am a bioinformatics scientist/computer scientist in the [Division of Genomic Diagnostics](https://www.chop.edu/centers-programs/division-genomic-diagnostics) at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, where I develop machine learning and data mining methods to facilitate pediatric clinical diagnostics.

I received my Ph.D from the [Computer Science Department of University of Cincinnati](https://ceas.uc.edu/academics/departments/electrical-engineering-computer-science.html), together with the [Biomedical Informatics Department of Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center](https://www.cincinnatichildrens.org/research/divisions/b/bmi). I also hold a MSc from the [Department of Electronic Enegineering at University of York](https://www.york.ac.uk/electronic-engineering/). 

I am interested in developing applications of machine learning in biomedical informatics, with a particular focus on genetics and genomics. I have also worked on problems such as gene-network mining, drug repurposing and ncRNA analysis.

You can find some of my previous works and ongoing projects on this site. If you are interested in my work or have questions, you may reach me [here](mailto:wuco@mail.uc.edu).
