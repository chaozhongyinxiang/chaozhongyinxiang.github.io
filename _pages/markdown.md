I have always wanted to be a theoretical physicist since I was a child, and I would not have believed I have become a computer scientist. However, Looking up into the sky at night and starring at those amazing stars in awe remains one of my favorite things to do.

I take huge pride in my hometown Beijing, for I was born and raised there. In my spare time, I look for fun things to do in and around Philadelphia. I enjoy [various trails](https://www.alltrails.com/parks/us/pennsylvania/fairmount-park) in Philly, exercising and would like to compete in another triathlon event soon. 

I enjoy a lot of sports, but am a huge soccer fan. My favorite teams are: [Beijing FC](http://www.fcguoan.com/en/), [Milan](https://www.acmilan.com/it) and [Italy International](https://www.figc.it/it/home/).
