A Github Pages template for academic websites. This was forked (then detached) from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://academicpages.github.io/), which is released under the MIT License. See LICENSE.md. A number of modifications were made to tailor to my needs.

### Note: if you are using this repo and now get a notification about a security vulnerability, delete the Gemfile.lock file.
